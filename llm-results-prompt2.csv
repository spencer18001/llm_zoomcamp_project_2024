Why did the narrator's companion lock the door at night?,"According to the original context provided from ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band,"" Mycroft suggests that Mrs. Black was locking herself in at night as a precautionary measure, believing her sister might be more cunning than she is and could potentially harm or catch up with someone on their trail during the nighttime (""As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side.""). The exact reason for locking themselves in each time is not explicitly stated but seems to relate to ensuring safety against an undisclosed and cunning adversary.


Inference based on the context: Mrs. Black secures herself possibly due to paranoia about someone (her sister, as one deduces from later clues) scheming or targeting her at nights (""Indeed,"" said Holmes. ""Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?"").",44
